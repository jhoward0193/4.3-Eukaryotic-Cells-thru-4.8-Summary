    Eukaryotic Cells (Chapter 4.3)
  </h1>

  <p>
    Section 4.3 builds on the comparison between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
    by focusing on the defining structural features that distinguish
    <strong>eukaryotic cells</strong>. The emphasis in lecture was not simply on
    naming organelles, but on understanding how compartmentalization allows
    eukaryotic cells to perform complex, coordinated functions.
  </p>

    alt="Eukaryotic cell complexity graph"
    style="width:45%; max-width:400px; border-radius:4px;">
</div>




    <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Defining Features of Eukaryotic Cells</h3>

    <p>
      Eukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of internal, membrane-bound
      compartments that divide the cell into specialized regions. These compartments
      allow different biochemical processes to occur simultaneously without
      interfering with one another.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Key defining features include:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>membrane-bound nucleus</strong></li>
      <li>An extensive <strong>endomembrane system</strong></li>
      <li>Numerous specialized <strong>organelles</strong></li>
      <li>A complex <strong>cytoskeleton</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Unlike prokaryotes, which typically rely on spatial organization within a
      single cytoplasmic space, eukaryotic cells use membranes to regulate internal
      environments.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#00285a;">The Nucleus: The Information Center</h3>

    <p>
      The nucleus serves as the primary information center of the eukaryotic cell.
      It houses the cell’s genetic material and regulates gene expression.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Key structural features include:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>double membrane</strong> called the nuclear envelope</li>
      <li><strong>Nuclear pores</strong> that control the movement of molecules</li>
      <li>A dense region called the <strong>nucleolus</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      DNA within the nucleus is organized into multiple
      <strong>linear chromosomes</strong> associated with proteins, forming
      chromatin, which is directly linked to gene expression. This organization
      allows precise control over which genes are expressed in a given cell type.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nucleolus is the site where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed and
      ribosomal subunits are assembled before being exported to the cytoplasm.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Ribosomes: A Universal Feature</h3>

    <p>
      Although eukaryotic cells are structurally complex, they share essential
      features with all other cells. One of the most important of these is the
      presence of <strong>ribosomes</strong>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Ribosomes:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Translate messenger RNA into proteins</li>
      <li>Are found in all cells—prokaryotic and eukaryotic</li>
      <li>Can be free in the cytoplasm or bound to the rough ER</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The universality of ribosomes underscores the shared evolutionary origin of
      all life.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Compartmentalization and Cellular Efficiency</h3>

    <p>
      The internal organization of eukaryotic cells allows for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Separation of incompatible chemical reactions</li>
      <li>Greater efficiency and regulation</li>
      <li>Increased cell size without loss of function</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For example, enzymes involved in lipid synthesis are localized to the smooth
      ER, while enzymes involved in protein modification are concentrated in the
      Golgi apparatus. This spatial separation improves both speed and accuracy.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#00285a;">The Cytoskeleton as an Internal Framework</h3>

    <p>
      Eukaryotic cells possess a well-developed cytoskeleton composed of three
      major filament types:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Actin filaments (microfilaments)</li>
      <li>Microtubules</li>
      <li>Intermediate filaments</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>These fibers provide:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Structural support</li>
      <li>Organization of organelles</li>
      <li>Pathways for intracellular transport</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Motor proteins move along cytoskeletal tracks using ATP. For example,
      myosin interacts with actin filaments during cell crawling and later becomes
      especially important in <strong>muscle cells</strong>, where coordinated
      actin–myosin interactions produce contraction.
    </p>

  <h1 style="color:#00285a; border-bottom:2px solid #00285a; padding-bottom:6px;">
    The Endomembrane System (Chapter 4.4)
  </h1>

  <p>
    Section 4.4 introduces the <strong>endomembrane system</strong>, a network of
    membranes that divides the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells into functional
    compartments. The central idea emphasized in lecture is that
    compartmentalization allows the cell to carry out complex chemical processes
    efficiently and in a regulated manner.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Overview of the Endomembrane System</h3>

  <p>
    The endomembrane system includes membranes that are either physically connected
    or exchange materials through vesicles. Together, these structures coordinate
    the synthesis, modification, transport, and degradation of macromolecules.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Major components include:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Nuclear envelope</li>
    <li>Endoplasmic reticulum (rough and smooth)</li>
    <li>Golgi apparatus</li>
    <li>Lysosomes</li>
    <li>Transport vesicles</li>
    <li>Vacuoles (in plants and some protists)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)</h3>

  <p>
    The rough ER is distinguished by ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface.
    These ribosomes synthesize:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Proteins destined for secretion</li>
    <li>Proteins inserted into membranes</li>
    <li>Proteins targeted to specific organelles</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As proteins are synthesized, they enter the lumen of the RER, where they may
    begin folding and undergo early chemical modification.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)</h3>

  <p>
    The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks bound ribosomes and contains embedded
    enzymes that support several key cellular functions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Synthesis of lipids, phospholipids, and steroid hormones</li>
    <li>Carbohydrate metabolism</li>
    <li>Detoxification of drugs and poisons, especially in liver cells</li>
    <li>Storage and regulated release of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In muscle cells, specialized smooth ER (the sarcoplasmic reticulum) plays a
    critical role in contraction by releasing and reabsorbing Ca<sup>2+</sup>
    ions, illustrating how the same organelle can be functionally specialized in
    different cell types.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Golgi Apparatus</h3>

  <p>
    The Golgi apparatus functions as the cell’s central processing, sorting, and
    distribution center for proteins and lipids received from the endoplasmic
    reticulum.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Its roles include:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Chemical modification of proteins</li>
    <li>Sorting macromolecules by their cellular destination</li>
    <li>Packaging materials into transport vesicles</li>
    <li>Contributing to the synthesis and renewal of cellular membranes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Golgi apparatus has a distinct polarity: the <em>cis</em> face receives
    vesicles from the ER, while the <em>trans</em> face directs vesicles to specific
    destinations, such as the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or secretion outside
    the cell.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Lysosomes</h3>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:1.5em 0;">

</div>

  <p>
    Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that originate from the Golgi
    apparatus and contain digestive enzymes.
  </p>

  <p><strong>These enzymes:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Break down macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates</li>
    <li>Recycle components of old or damaged organelles</li>
    <li>Function optimally at an acidic pH</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By isolating these enzymes within membranes, the cell prevents accidental
    damage to other cellular structures. Uncontrolled release of lysosomal enzymes
    could damage or destroy the cell.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Vacuoles</h3>

  <p>
    Vacuoles are most prominent in plant cells, where a large central vacuole may
    occupy most of the cell’s volume.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Functions include:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Storage of water, ions, and metabolites</li>
    <li>Regulation of internal pressure (turgor)</li>
    <li>Contribution to cell growth</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The vacuolar membrane, called the <strong>tonoplast</strong>, contains channels
    that regulate the movement of water and solutes, helping maintain cellular
    tonicity and osmotic balance. Some fungi and protists also use vacuoles for
    water balance.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Lipid Droplets and Microbodies</h3>

  <p>
    Lipid droplets store neutral lipids and consist of lipid cores surrounded by
    a phospholipid monolayer. These structures provide an efficient way to store
    energy-rich molecules.
  </p>

  <p>
    Microbodies are a diverse group of organelles that include
    <strong>peroxisomes</strong>. Peroxisomes contain enzymes that:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Oxidize fatty acids</li>
    <li>Participate in detoxification reactions</li>
    <li>Utilize peroxide in metabolic reactions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Peroxisomes contain the enzyme catalase, which decomposes hydrogen peroxide
    according to the reaction:
  </p>

  <h1 style="color:#00285a; border-bottom:2px solid #00285a; padding-bottom:6px;">
    Mitochondria and Chloroplasts (Chapter 4.5)
  </h1>

  <p>
    Section 4.5 focuses on the organelles responsible for cellular energy
    transformations: <strong>mitochondria</strong> and
    <strong>chloroplasts</strong>. Emphasis is placed on how their structure
    reflects their function and how multiple lines of evidence support their
    evolutionary origin through endosymbiosis.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Mitochondria: Cellular Powerhouses</h3>

  <div style="text-align:center; margin:1.5em 0;">
    <img src="images/mitochondria.jpg"
         alt="Structure of a mitochondrion"
         style="width:85%; max-width:480px;">
  </div>

  <p>
    Mitochondria are the primary sites of ATP production in eukaryotic cells.
    Most cellular ATP is generated through metabolic reactions that occur within
    this organelle.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Key structural features include:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>double membrane</strong></li>
    <li>A smooth outer membrane</li>
    <li>A highly folded inner membrane forming <strong>cristae</strong></li>
    <li>An internal fluid-filled space called the <strong>matrix</strong></li>
    <li>A compartment between membranes called the <strong>intermembrane space</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The extensive folding of the inner membrane increases surface area, allowing
    more proteins involved in energy metabolism to be embedded in the membrane.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Mitochondrial Function</h3>

  <p>
    Proteins located on the inner membrane and within the matrix carry out the
    reactions that lead to ATP synthesis. These reactions involve the controlled
    transfer of energy through metabolic pathways rather than direct combustion
    of fuels.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because ATP is required for nearly all cellular processes, mitochondria are
    essential for the survival of most eukaryotic cells.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mitochondria are not synthesized de novo. Instead, they divide independently
    within the cell, and their numbers increase prior to cell division. Most
    proteins required for mitochondrial structure and division are encoded by
    genes in the nucleus.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Chloroplasts: Energy Conversion via Light</h3>

  <p>
    Chloroplasts are found in plants and some protists and are responsible for
    capturing light energy and converting it into chemical energy.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Structural features include:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>double outer membrane</strong></li>
    <li>An internal system of flattened membranes called <strong>thylakoids</strong></li>
    <li>Stacks of thylakoids known as <strong>grana</strong></li>
    <li>An internal fluid-filled space called the <strong>stroma</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Light-dependent reactions occur on the thylakoid membranes, while the synthesis
    of sugars occurs in the stroma.
  </p>

  <div style="text-align:center; margin:1.5em 0;">
    <img src="images/chloroplasts.jpg"
         alt="Structure of a chloroplast"
         style="width:85%; max-width:480px;">
  </div>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Functional Parallels Between Organelles</h3>

  <p>
    Despite their different roles, mitochondria and chloroplasts share several
    important characteristics:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Both generate ATP</li>
    <li>Both contain their own DNA</li>
    <li>Both divide independently within the cell</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These shared features suggest a common evolutionary origin.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#00285a;">Endosymbiotic Theory</h3>

  <p>
    The endosymbiotic theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated
    as free-living prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by an ancestral host cell.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Evidence supporting this theory includes:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The presence of double membranes</li>
    <li>Circular DNA similar to bacterial chromosomes</li>
    <li>Independent replication within the cell</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Over time, these engulfed cells formed stable, mutually beneficial
    relationships with their hosts and became permanent organelles. Without these
    organelles, the energetic demands of complex life would not be sustainable.
  </p>




 <div class="section-divider"></div>
<h2>4.6 The Cytoskeleton (Chapter 4.6)</h2>

<p>
Section 4.6 introduces the <strong>cytoskeleton</strong>, a dynamic network of
protein fibers that provides structural support, organizes the cell interior,
and enables movement of both cells and intracellular components. Emphasis is
placed on the cytoskeleton as an <em>active, adaptable system</em> rather than
static scaffolding.
</p>

<div class="float-img center">
  <img
    src="https://github.com/jhoward0193/4.3-Eukaryotic-Cells-thru-4.8-Summary/blob/24b138cc4bac2f192e48a726a4a6cf8da1ba1251/images/cytoskeleton.png?raw=true"
    alt="Components of the cytoskeleton">
</div>

<h3>Overview of the Cytoskeleton</h3>

<p>
The cytoskeleton is composed of crisscrossing protein fibers that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain cell shape</li>
  <li>Anchor and organize organelles</li>
  <li>Enable intracellular transport</li>
  <li>Drive cell movement and division</li>
</ul>

<p>
Eukaryotic cells possess three major types of cytoskeletal filaments, each with
distinct structures and functions.
</p>

<h3>Microfilaments (Actin Filaments)</h3>

<p>
<strong>Microfilaments</strong> are long, thin fibers composed of the protein
<strong>actin</strong>. They are especially important in cell shape and movement.
</p>

<p><strong>Functions include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Cell crawling and migration</li>
  <li>Formation of the cell cortex beneath the plasma membrane</li>
  <li>Muscle contraction when interacting with myosin</li>
</ul>

<p>
During cell crawling, actin polymerization pushes the plasma membrane forward,
while myosin contracts actin filaments to pull the cell body toward the leading
edge. This same actin–myosin interaction is later adapted in
<strong>muscle cells</strong> to produce contraction.
</p>

<h3>Microtubules</h3>

<p>
<strong>Microtubules</strong> are hollow cylinders composed of tubulin proteins.
They are the largest and most rigid cytoskeletal elements and serve as structural
tracks within the cell.
</p>

<p><strong>Key roles include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Transport of vesicles and organelles</li>
  <li>Formation of the mitotic spindle during cell division</li>
  <li>Structural support for cilia and flagella</li>
</ul>

<p>
Microtubules originate from organizing centers such as the
<strong>centrosome</strong> and extend outward through the cytoplasm.
</p>

<h3>Intermediate Filaments</h3>

<p>
<strong>Intermediate filaments</strong> are composed of various fibrous proteins,
including keratin and vimentin. Their primary role is mechanical strength rather
than movement.
</p>

<p><strong>Functions include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Resistance to mechanical stress</li>
  <li>Maintenance of cell integrity</li>
  <li>Stabilization of cell shape over time</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unlike microfilaments and microtubules, intermediate filaments are relatively
stable and less dynamic.
</p>

<h3>Molecular Motors and Intracellular Transport</h3>

<p>
The cytoskeleton functions as a system of tracks for motor proteins that move
materials within the cell.
</p>

<p><strong>Important motor proteins include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kinesin</strong>, which typically transports cargo along microtubules toward the cell periphery</li>
  <li><strong>Dynein</strong>, which generally moves cargo toward the cell center</li>
  <li><strong>Myosin</strong>, which moves along actin filaments</li>
</ul>

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; margin:2em 0;">

    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

<p>
These motor proteins use energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport vesicles,
organelles, and other cargo, functioning analogously to trains moving along rails.
</p>

<h3>Centrosomes and Cell Division</h3>

<p>
<strong>Centrosomes</strong> act as microtubule-organizing centers in animal cells
and typically contain a pair of centrioles. They play a critical role during cell
division by helping assemble the mitotic spindle that separates chromosomes into
daughter cells.
</p>

<h3>Functional Significance of the Cytoskeleton</h3>

<p>
The cytoskeleton allows cells to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change shape in response to signals</li>
  <li>Move toward or away from stimuli</li>
  <li>Organize internal components efficiently</li>
  <li>Divide accurately during reproduction</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because these functions are essential for life, defects in cytoskeletal
components often lead to serious cellular and organismal dysfunction.

    Extracellular Structures and Cell Movement (Chapter 4.7)
  </h1>


<p>
Section 4.7 examines how cells move and interact with their surroundings. The
lecture emphasized that cellular movement can be driven by internal cytoskeletal
forces or by external structures, and that animal cells are embedded within an
extracellular matrix that actively influences cell behavior.
</p>

<h3>Modes of Cellular Movement</h3>

<p>
Cells move using different strategies depending on cell type and environment.
Two major categories of movement were emphasized:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cell crawling</strong>, driven by internal cytoskeletal proteins</li>
  <li><strong>Surface appendages</strong>, such as cilia or flagella</li>
</ul>

<p>
These mechanisms rely on different molecular systems but share the common goal
of repositioning cells or moving fluids.
</p>

<h3>Cell Crawling</h3>

<p>
Cell crawling occurs when actin filaments polymerize beneath the plasma membrane,
pushing it forward. At the same time, myosin motors pull the cell body in the same
direction.
</p>

<p>
This process is especially important during:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development</li>
  <li>Wound healing</li>
  <li>Immune cell movement</li>
</ul>

<p>
The actin–myosin interaction used in cell crawling is also adapted for muscle
contraction, where highly ordered arrays of these proteins generate force at the
tissue level.
</p>

<h3>Cilia and Flagella in Eukaryotic Cells</h3>

<p>
Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are external structures used for movement or fluid
transport. They share a characteristic internal arrangement of microtubules
known as the <strong>9 + 2 structure</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>Key features include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bundles of microtubules surrounded by membrane</li>
  <li>Whip-like, undulating motion</li>
  <li>A basal body that anchors the structure to the cell</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cilia are typically short and numerous, while flagella are longer and fewer in
number.

<h3>Prokaryotic Flagella</h3>

<p>
Prokaryotic flagella differ fundamentally from eukaryotic flagella in both
structure and energy source. Bacterial flagella rotate like propellers and are
powered by proton gradients across the plasma membrane.
</p>

<p>
Archaeal motility structures, called <strong>archaella</strong>, resemble
bacterial flagella in appearance but are powered by ATP hydrolysis. These
similarities reflect convergent evolution rather than shared ancestry.
</p>

<h3>Plant Cell Walls</h3>

<p>
Plant cells possess rigid cell walls composed primarily of cellulose fibers.
These walls:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide protection and mechanical support</li>
  <li>Maintain cell shape</li>
  <li>Resist osmotic pressure</li>
</ul>

<p>
Adjacent plant cells are held together by the <strong>middle lamella</strong>,
contributing to tissue integrity.
</p>

<h3>Extracellular Matrix (ECM) in Animal Cells</h3>

<p>
Animal cells do not have cell walls. Instead, they secrete a complex network of
glycoproteins known as the <strong>extracellular matrix (ECM)</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>Major components include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Collagen</li>
  <li>Elastin</li>
  <li>Fibronectin</li>
  <li>Proteoglycans</li>
</ul>

<p>
The ECM provides structural support, strength, and elasticity to tissues.
</p>

<h3>Integrins and Cell–ECM Interactions</h3>

<p>
<strong>Integrins</strong> are transmembrane proteins that link the ECM to the
cytoskeleton. Through these connections, integrins allow the ECM to influence
cell behavior.
</p>

<p><strong>Integrin signaling can:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Alter gene expression</li>
  <li>Influence cell migration</li>
  <li>Coordinate mechanical and chemical signals</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this way, the ECM is not merely structural but plays an active role in
regulating cellular function.
</p>

<h3>Functional Significance of Extracellular Structures</h3>

<p>
Extracellular structures and movement systems allow cells to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Respond dynamically to their environment</li>
  <li>Coordinate behavior within tissues</li>
  <li>Maintain tissue structure under mechanical stress</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.8 Cell-to-Cell Interactions (Chapter 4.8)</h2>

<p>
Section 4.8 explains how individual cells become organized into tissues and
coordinate their behavior. Emphasis is placed on the role of surface proteins,
junctions, and communication systems that allow cells to recognize one another,
adhere together, and exchange information.
</p>

<h3>Cell Identity and Surface Proteins</h3>

<p>
Cells in multicellular organisms must identify themselves as belonging to a
specific tissue or organism. This identity is established through proteins and
glycolipids embedded in the plasma membrane.
</p>

<p>
Many cell-surface markers are <strong>glycolipids</strong>, which consist of
lipids with carbohydrate chains projecting outward from the membrane. These
markers allow cells to recognize neighboring cells and respond appropriately.
</p>

<p>
In humans, glycolipid surface markers are responsible for the <strong>A, B, and O
blood types</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Self vs. Nonself Recognition</h3>

<p>
A critical function of cell-surface markers is distinguishing
<strong>self</strong> from <strong>nonself</strong>. In vertebrates, this role is
carried out by proteins encoded by the
<strong>major histocompatibility complex (MHC)</strong>.
</p>

    alt="Major histocompatibility complex and immune recognition">
</div>

<p>
MHC proteins allow immune cells to recognize foreign or abnormal cells, a process
essential for defense against pathogens and cancer.
</p>

<h3>Cell Junctions and Physical Connections</h3>

<p>
Cells can be physically connected through specialized structures known as
<strong>cell junctions</strong>. These junctions allow cells to adhere to one
another and, in some cases, directly exchange materials.
</p>

    alt="Types of cell junctions">
</div>

<p><strong>Major types of cell junctions include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tight junctions</strong>, which form seals between cells</li>
  <li><strong>Desmosomes</strong>, which provide strong mechanical attachments</li>
  <li><strong>Gap junctions</strong>, which allow direct cytoplasmic communication
      between adjacent cells</li>
</ul>

<p>
These junctions are critical for maintaining tissue integrity and coordinating
cellular activity.
</p>

<h3>Functional Significance of Cell Communication</h3>

<p>
Cell-to-cell communication systems allow multicellular organisms to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coordinate cell behavior within tissues</li>
  <li>Mount effective immune responses</li>
  <li>Maintain internal homeostasis</li>
</ul>
